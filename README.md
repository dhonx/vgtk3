# GTK3 V
This is a wrapper for gtk3 in V. The advantage with using C.<function> is that gtk3-v uses V structs.
*TODO: readme*

**Warning: Due to changes in the interface system, the current (dev) versino of the V compiler cannot compile Gtk3-V successfully, for this reason the stable release V 0.1.22 is necessary for using it**
